# Blueprint appendix (LaTeX)

This folder contains a paper-style appendix section that mirrors the Lean development in:

- `RESEARCHER_BUNDLE/HeytingLean/ClosingTheLoop/**`

Files:

- `closing_the_loop_appendix.tex`: intended to be copy/pasted or `\\input{}`-included into a larger LaTeX paper.
- `closing_the_loop_appendix_standalone.tex`: minimal standalone wrapper so a reader can compile the appendix by itself.
